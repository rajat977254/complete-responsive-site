            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> First of all, education gives the ability to read and write to anyone. A good education is extremely essential for everyone to grow and succeed in life. Education increases self-confidence and assists in developing the personality of a person. Education plays a big role in our life. Education is split into 3 parts such as primary education, secondary education, and higher secondary education. All these 3 divisions of education have their value and advantages. Primary education is the base of education for a person, secondary education paves the direction for further education and higher secondary education makes the future and the ultimate way of life</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> As much as learning is an on going process, skills development follows the same trend. Nowadays, competition has been the hallmark in every corporate endeavour and to say the least, each product seeks for competitive edge. I must not stay behind in this race for leadership and excellence because my future employability depends largely on how I perfected my skills during this period of continuing skill development and advancement. </p>
